1. Scope and Limitations of the License
All licensed deliveries of the DNA products are subject to this agreement and are protected by national and international agreements for copyrights. None of the deliveries may be copied, transferred or distributed in electronic or any other way unless as explicitly granted in this agreement. Licensee may incorporate the DNA product library into licensee's product and   distribute it once to its customers solely as incorporated into licensee's product.  
DNA grants the licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to install and use a copy of the software for the sole purpose of incorporating the DNA product into licensee's product. The license is granted for an undetermined period of time. The licensee may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the DNA products. DNA has the right to terminate the right to use the programs if the licensee fails to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case the licensee shall destroy all copies of the programs.
Licensee shall not distribute DNA products whether incorporated or not in licensee’s own product which can be used by licensee's customers as a software development kit or as components enabling licensee's customers to produce software for routing, scheduling or optimization purposes.
Due to existing exclusive partner agreements on DNA products, licensee's products using these DNA products shall not be used or licensed to licensee’s customers working for or in the Field Service Industry (worldwide). Should licensee intend to license licensee's product using one or more of DNA products in this industry branch, licensee is obliged to contact DNA to receive a written approval for the requested end customer before using DNA products.
The software may only be operated in the way described in the user manual. Except as permitted under Section 1 above, the licensee may not modify, change, extend, translate, deassemble, decompile or reverse-engineer the software or parts of it. It is not allowed to make any copies of the software unless as granted in this agreement.
2. Terms
The term software determines all programmes, applets, data bases, operation systems, files or similar electronic data provided on a data storage or downloaded over the web, by e-mail or any other electronic way.
3. License
The software is licensed to the licensee but it is not sold. DNA holds all rights on the software if it was not explicitly transferred to the licensee. Except with respect to the rights granted in Section 1 regarding DNA product, licensee shall not make any copies of the software or of parts of the software, rent, loan, sell, or in other way distribute unless for one single copy for back-up purposes.
6. Disclosure
The licensee is obliged to prevent the software or any benchmark results from disclosure. 
7. Disclaimer of Warranty
DNA warrants that (i) it has the right to grant licensee the rights under this agreement; and (ii) the software will work in accordance with the user documentation. As licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and DNA’s entire liability for any breach of the foregoing performance warranty, DNA will fix, provide a work around, or otherwise repair or replace the nonconforming software, or, if DNA is unable to do so, terminate the license for the software and return the fees paid to DNA for the nonconforming software. Except for the foregoing warranties, the software is provided ‚as is’ without warranty of any kind. We further disclaim all warranties, express and implied, including without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Except for the indemnification obligations of either party or either party’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct in no event shall either party be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages, or damages for loss of profits, revenue, data or data use, incurred any party, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if such party has been advised of the possibilities of such damages. Except for the indemnification obligations of either party or either party’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct, each party’s entire liability for damages hereunder shall in no event exceed the purchase price of the software. 
8. Property Rights and Indemnification
The software is protected by international copyright agreements. The licensee accepts that no intellectual property rights are transferred by this software and that all rights remain explicitly at DNA.
DNA shall defend, indemnify and hold licensee harmless against any loss, damage or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with claims, demands, suits, or proceedings ("Claims") made or brought against licensee by a third party alleging that use of the software as contemplated hereunder infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party, provided licensee (a) promptly gives written notice of the Claim to DNA; (b) gives DNA sole control of the defence and settlement of the Claim (provided that DNA may not settle any Claim unless it unconditionally releases licensee of all liability); and (c) provides to DNA, at DNA' s cost, all reasonable assistance. DNA will, at its sole option and expense: (i) procure for licensee the right to continue using the software under the terms of this agreement; (ii) replace or modify the software to be non-infringing without material decrease in functionality; or (iii) if the foregoing options are not reasonably practicable, terminate the license for the infringing software and refund Licensee all prepaid fees for the remainder of its subscription term after the date of termination. DNA shall have no liability for any Claim to the extent the Claim is based upon (i) the use of the software in combination with any other product, service or device not furnished, recommended or approved by DNA, if such Claim would have been avoided by the use of the software, without such product, service or device; or (ii) Licensee’s use of the software other than in accordance with this Agreement.

The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most nearly effects the parties original intent in entering into this Agreement or to provide an equitable adjustment in the event no such provision can be added. The other provisions of this agreement will remain in full force and effect.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
for Apache 2.0


•	CC0
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. 
Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: 
I.	the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
II.	moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
III.	publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
IV.	rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
V.	rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
VI.	database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
VII.	other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
a.	No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b.	Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c.	Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
d.	Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

2.	Application of Conditions
2.1	These Conditions shall apply to and be incorporated into the Contract and shall prevail over any inconsistent terms or conditions contained, or referred to in the Customer’s purchase order, confirmation of order, acceptance of a quotation, or specification or other Document supplied by the Customer, or implied by law, trade custom, practice or course of dealing. Any variation to these Conditions and any representations about the Goods or Services to be delivered under the Contract shall have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of the Supplier.
2.2	The Customer’s purchase order, or the Customer’s acceptance of a quotation for the provision of the Goods or Services (as the case may be) by the Supplier, constitutes an offer by the Customer to purchase the Goods, Licenses or Services (as the case may be) on these Conditions. No offer placed by the Customer shall be accepted by the Supplier other than:
2.2.1.	By a written acknowledgement issued and executed by the Supplier; or
2.2.2.	(If earlier) by the Supplier starting to provide the Services or deliver the Goods to
	the Customer,
2.2.3.	When the Contract for the provision of the Goods or Services (as the case may
	be) shall be established. The Customer’s standard terms and conditions (if any) 
	attached to, enclosed with or referred to in any purchase order or other Document
	shall not govern the Contract.
2.3	Quotations are given by the Supplier on the basis that no Contract shall come into existence except in accordance with Condition 2.2. Any quotation is valid for a period of twenty-eight (28) days from its date, provided that the Supplier has not previously withdrawn it.
2.4	The Customer acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the Supplier which is not set out in the Contract. Nothing in this Condition shall exclude or limit the Supplier’s liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.
2.5	Nothing in these Conditions shall prejudice any condition or warranty, express or implied, or any legal remedy to which the Supplier may be entitled in relation to the Goods or Services (as the case may be), by virtue of any statute law or regulation.


3.	Price and Payment
3.1	The price for the Goods, Licenses or Services (as the case may be) shall be as set out in the Contract and is subject to any applicable charges and only where stated in the Contract is inclusive of VAT.
3.2	In respect of any Services, the Supplier shall endeavour to work within the Contract price but reserves the right to make charges based on the actual cost of the Services. If the Services cannot be completed within the authorised financial limit the Supplier shall notify the Customer as soon as possible and limit expenditure to the authorised amount pending further instructions from the Customer.
3.3	For all Contracts with a value over one thousand Euros (1,000€) the Supplier reserves the right to invoice one-third of the Contract price on acceptance of the Contract, which if so requested must be paid in accordance with the Supplier’s normal payment terms and conditions as set out in this Condition. The balance of the Contract price will be invoiced on completion of the Contract or completion of report (as the case may be) and payment is due ten (10) days following the date of the invoice, unless stage payments or alternative arrangements have been agreed with the Customer, in writing, in advance. Interest may be charged, at the Supplier’s discretion, at four (4) percent above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) base rate, from time to time, on any part of the invoice unpaid after this time, or the time as agreed in writing with the Customer. The price for Services is due in advance in its entire annual amount on the 1st of January of the relevant year. The price will be invoiced by the Customer. The price is considered as paid at the moment of inscribing the amount in favour of the bank account set in invoice. 
3.4	Without prejudice to any other rights of the Supplier, if the Customer shall fail to make payment in full in accordance with this Condition the Supplier shall be entitled to suspend this or any other Contract with the Customer and in such event the Customer shall not in any respect be released from its obligations to the Supplier under this or any other Contract. Alternatively, the Supplier shall be entitled to terminate this Contract or any other Contract with the Customer in accordance with these Conditions and to claim damages from the Customer for this breach.

	as they fall due, or an administrative receiver or receiver or manager of its undertaking
	is duly appointed by a creditor or by the court, or possession is taken of any of its 
	property by an encumbrancer and in that event such termination shall not affect any
	rights which the Supplier may have against the Customer in consequence of the
	breach by the Customer; or.
6.2.5.	If the Supplier is of the belief that the Customer is using the Goods, Licenses 
	or Services (as the case may be) with fraudulent or criminal intent.
6.3	On termination of the Contract the Customer shall immediately pay to the Supplier all of the Supplier’s outstanding unpaid invoices and interest (if applicable) and in respect of any Goods Licenses, or Services (as the case may be) supplied, but for which no invoice has been submitted, the Supplier may submit an invoice, which shall be payable immediately on receipt.
6.4	The accrued rights and liabilities of the parties as at termination and the continuation of any provision expressly stated to survive or implicitly surviving termination shall not be affected.

7.1	Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of its obligations if the delay or failure results from events or circumstances outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, lock outs, accidents, war or fire and the party shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of its obligations. In such an event the Supplier reserves the right to all sums owing for any Services of Goods supplied to the Customer up the date of such event.
