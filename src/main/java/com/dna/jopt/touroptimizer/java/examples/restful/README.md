# RESTful Examples

Containerizing an application helps to use it more conveniently across different platforms and, most importantly, as a microservice. Further, scaling an application becomes more straightforward as different standardized orchestration tools can be utilized. It can be launched either (locally) as part of a docker-compose or as a highly-scalable web-micro-service in a Kubernetes cluster, to give an example. RESTful JOptTourOptimizer can be used as a Docker container utilizing Spring WebFlux and Swagger. Internally the Java version of TourOptimizer is utilized.
